            <h2>Banned Books</h2>
            <p>This chart represents a timeline of some notable books: when they were banned, when the ban was lifted, and where.
                <br>Looking at when and where a specific book was banned gives us insight into the world. 
                <br>For example, the works of Einstein were banned in Germany by the Nazis in 1925 to promote Anti-Semitism, and branded his work as "Jewish Physics".

            <p>These custom visualizations were created using D3.js. They show a more traditional gantt chart as well as a more innovative one representing a stack of books.</p>
