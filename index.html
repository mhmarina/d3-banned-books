            <p>This chart represents a timeline of some notable books: when they were banned, when the ban was lifted, and where.
                Looking at when and where a specific book was banned gives us insight into the world. 
                For example, the works of Einstein were banned in Germany by the Nazis in 1925 to promote Anti-Semitism, and branded his work as "Jewish Physics".

                These custom visualizations were created using <b>D3.js</b>. They show a more traditional Gantt chart and a more innovative one representing a stack of books.
